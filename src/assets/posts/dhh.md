I recently finished [Lex Fridman's podcast with David Heinemeier Hansson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vagyIcmIGOQ&ab_channel=LexFridman).  To be honest, I wasn’t familiar with DHH before this episode — but after spending over six hours listening, I’m glad I tuned in.

The conversation really resonated with me and inspired me to try two things:

- Explore `Ruby`, and maybe even dive into `Ruby on Rails`
- Start self-hosting and move away from the cloud. I’m planning to get my own server and begin by hosting this website myself.

One thing I really agree with DHH on is his take on small teams. Increasing the size of a team doesn’t necessarily increase output — it probably decreases it. My belief is that 3–4 people is the sweet spot.

Developers create value by writing code, not by attending meetings. Most developers need long periods of uninterrupted time, and in general, the larger the team, the less coding time each developer gets.

Most meetings aren’t necessary if you cut the layers and let developers interact directly with business users. If someone *must* interrupt developers, it should be the users or the direct business stakeholders, they’re the ones who can help steer the application in the right direction. It definitely shouldn’t be a random person inviting everyone to a sprint planning session.
